  # Book Search Engine

  ## Description

  This application is a search engine for books. It was designed as a practice project for myself to better grasp GraphQL and Apollo Server. The application is a website that allows a user to search for books and save them should they be logged in. A logged in user can view all of their saved books as well, and remove any of them at any time should they wish.

  ## Installation

  To install the application on your local machine, start by cloning the repository to a local file. Once the application has been cloned and you have navigated into the source folder via your terminal, run the command 'npm i' to install all of the needed dependencies. Once the dependencies have been installed, you can run the commands 'npm run build' and 'npm start' to run the server on your local machine or 'npm run develop' to run the application without needing a build.

  ## Usage

  If the application is installed on your local maching, you can navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to see the client side of the application. From this site page, you can search up books via the search bar, or login via the login/sign up button at the top right of the screen> If the user is logged in, they can save books by clicking 'Save this Book!' below each book card. Next to the login/logout button is a button that reads 'See Your Books' where you can view all of your saved books. There will also be an option to remove your saved books by clicking the button at the bottom of the book's card, similarly to how they were saved.
